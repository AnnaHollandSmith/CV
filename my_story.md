I am a former criminal lawyer and a graduate of Makers Academy.

Prior to Makers Academy, my first exposure to coding and the experience that ignited my desire for a career-change, came in the form of CodeFirst: Girls. Code First is a non-profit that seeks to tackle the problematic gender parity in tech and entrepreneurship by providing introductory programming courses to female graduates and professionals. I completed their introductory course in December of 2015, and built and deployed my first website in the process.

Thanks in part to the extensive network that CodeFirst provides, I was able to actively engage with the Tech community and meet many people who had committed to a change of career as a web developer and for whom the perceived risk involved in such a decision had been rewarded.

Having completed the course, I continued to learn independently but felt the need to be in a more collaborative learning environment and the growing sense that this was something that extended beyond a hobby and that I wanted to dedicate more time (and ultimately my career) to. I was introduced, by another graduate of CodeFirst, to Makers Academy, an intensive 16-week coding bootcamp. In Makers I had found a community which would facilitate my continued learning and growth and enable me to pursue my chosen career as a web developer.

During my time at Makers Academy I learned how to think more like a programmer, write clean test-driven code, and pick up new languages and technologies. As such, I subscribe to Agile/XP values and would also look for opportunities to continue with TDD (test-driven development) and pair programming in any future role.

Following my graduation from Makers Academy, I successfully applied for my first software engineering role with the BBC.
