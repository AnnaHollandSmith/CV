I am a former Criminal Defence Lawyer, and am excited to begin my career as a web developer. I am a graduate of [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), an intensive 16 week coding bootcamp focused on Ruby and Javascript. During my time at Makers Academy I learned how to think more like a programmer, write clean test-driven code, and pick up new languages and technologies. I am looking for a junior developer role in which I can continue to learn and write code that can <strike>change the world</strike> positively influence people.   






I remain committed to various causes addressing important social issues and am a member of WHFNP (Women Hack for Non-Profits). Having benefitted  directly from organisations such a Code First: Girls, Codebar, and Women Who Code, I am committed to working towards increasing participation and diversity within the field.
